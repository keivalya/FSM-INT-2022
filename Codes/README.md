# FSM-INT-2022
INTP2022-ML-3

The entire project has been carried out in two different parts.
- Standalone real-time PCB Fault Detection using OpenCV
- Online Web-application to facilitate sequential analysis

Phases of the Project:

1. Understanding data and Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Model Building and Training
3. Model Hyperparameter tuning
4. Model comparison and testing
5. Model Deployment

Let us go through them one-by-one

## 1. Understanding the dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### About the Dataset
The collection comprises 1,500 picture pairs, each consisting of a template image devoid of defects and a tested image that has been aligned and annotated with the positions of the six most prevalent PCB defects: open, short, mouse bite, spur, pinhole, and spurious copper.
