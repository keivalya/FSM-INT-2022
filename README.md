# FSM-INT-2022
INTP2022-ML-3

The entire project has been carried out in two different parts.
- Standalone real-time PCB Fault Detection using OpenCV
- Online Web-application to facilitate sequential analysis

Phases of the Project:

1. Understanding data and Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Model Building and Training
3. Model Hyperparameter tuning
4. Model comparison and testing
5. Model Deployment

Let us go through them one-by-one

## 1. Understanding the dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### About the Dataset
The collection comprises 1,500 picture pairs, each consisting of a template image devoid of defects and a tested image that has been aligned and annotated with the positions of the six most prevalent PCB defects: open, short, mouse bite, spur, pinhole, and spurious copper.

### About the image
The linear scan CCD used to capture each image in this collection has a resolution of about 48 pixels per millimeter. The defect-free template pictures are manually examined and cleaned from sampling photos. The original size of the template and the tested image is around 16k x 16k pixels. They are then divided into several 640 Ã— 640 pixels sub-images using a cropping process, then aligned using template matching methods. However, the 1500 defective PCB images and their annotation files are going to be primary resources for training our Deep Learning Model.


## Documentation is still in progress

Deployment

### Local Deployment and real-time fault using OpenCV
Run the following command in Linux/Ubuntu (after installing requirements)
```
python3 main.py
```


```
pip install pip-tools
pip-compile requirements.in
```
